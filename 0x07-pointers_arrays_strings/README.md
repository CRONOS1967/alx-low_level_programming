## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to
anyone](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/YpzhlccIJNihbnYgObEStg "explain to anyone"),
**without the help of Google**:

### General

  - What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
  - What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
  - What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate
    strings

## Requirements

### General

  - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
  - All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`,
    using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
  - All your files should end with a new line
  - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is
    mandatory
  - Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using
    [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl "betty-style.pl")
    and
    [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl "betty-doc.pl")
  - You are not allowed to use global variables
  - No more than 5 functions per file
  - You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of
    functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden
  - You are allowed to use
    [\_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c "_putchar")
  - You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do
    it won’t be taken into account
  - In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples.
    You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push
    them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We
    will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files
    might be different from the one shown in the examples
  - The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the
    function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called
    `main.h`
  - Don’t forget to push your header file

## More Info

You do not need to learn about pointers to functions, arrays of
structures, `malloc` and `free` - yet.
